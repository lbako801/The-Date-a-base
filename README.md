## The-Date-a-base
### Initial Ideas/Goals
Many couples are plagued with indecisiveness which can lead to stagnation of plans and frustration. This website will take all of that away by allowing users to choose a movie genre, cuisine, and alcoholic drink preference which will return them a randomized movie and food/drink recipes using three different APIs.
### User Story
#### AS A Couple -
We want to simplify and add excitement to date night.
#### SO THAT WE -
Can get movie, dinner recipe, and drink recipe recommendations from our chosen preferences.
